                Hello, my name is Brett Butler and for 30 years I have been
                rescuing and rehabilitating dogs for placement with new
                families. The last 8 years, corgis have been my sole focus.
                Corgis are such amazing, fun, smart, cute, energetic &
                challenging kids; they just won my heart. We corgi lovers know
                the addiction is real.

              Over time my home has emerged as an unofficial corgi sanctuary and
              rehab, whereby corgi rescuers nationwide bring corgis to me. I am
              very grateful to have their trust, and the ability to provide this
              service. My pack and I have built a solid reputation as we focus
              on helping corgis heal their spirits, resolve behavior issues, and
              repair trust. Itâ€™s a team effort of rescuers, my personal 5
              corgis, and the numbers of corgis who rotate in and out of my
              home. Consequently, I now have some corgis who will never leave
              due to issues. They function well in the structure of our pack,
              but we are unsure we can ever rehome them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
              Corgwyn Rehab is a Sanctuary for the hard luck cases, the last
              resort cases, the bad behavior cases. We have taken in many that
              were scheduled to be Euthanized but were sent here instead and now
              function as a vital part of my pack. Our Goal is the help these
              corgwyn get to a balanced state of being so they can function as a
              part of the pack. If, in time working with a dog, we see that they
              have the ability to be rehomed then we will see to that also. Our
              main function is not to rehome, it is to rehabilitate these
              special furkids. Some will be rehabilitated to that point but
              others will always be safe as a part of our pack. They are damaged
              too severely. I have learned that most of the damage is caused by
              forces outside of their control and with my help they can be
              turned around and function well in our pack.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg pt-8">
              This is an expensive endeavor. I am pursuing work to generate
              income for my base expenses; with additional funds needed to cover
              my corgi expenses. Last year my vet & med bills exceeded $8,000;
              and there was another $3,000 on food, toys & chew bones. I realize
              that in order for me to provide sanctuary for these corgis, I need
              investors help.
            </p>
            My short term goal is to continue to operate successfully in my
            current space (fenced yard, no kids). My long term goal is to find a
            property even more suited for a larger more private sanctuary. As of
            9/2018 we are close to reaching this goal.
            <p class="text-lg pt-8">
              I have three primary areas of expense: Veterinary medicine, food
              and consumables, and supplies (to include the wear and tear on my
              home (carpet, doors, drywall, trim; which I can do the labor
              myself). My desire is to create sponsorships or donation streams
              that can fund these accounts (all overseen by others not just me).
              Until we get 501c3 status, donors are welcome to donate directly
              to our vet, and trust that this is not in any way funding my
              personal life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg pt-8">
              I am working with other experienced rescuers for advice and
              direction. My hope is that by assembling a core team of advisors
              and investors we can create a corgi sanctuary and serve the needs
              of corgis from our central location. I decided to take a risk and
              humbly ask for your support, because I know the incredible power
              of passionate people working in groups as I was part of the
              initial creation of the Corgi Coalition Transport Team. CCTT
              showed me that those of us with a will, find a way. And I know
              that if I reach out many great people will enable miracles to
              happen.

              Our CRS administrators, at present, consists of myself, Brett
              Butler, and our secretary, LeAnne Foust. Due to my job, I may not
              be able to answer you as quickly as LeAnne can. Please know that
              we are in daily contact and she will always make sure I am
              informed. She is running our paperwork side of this endeavor and I
              am working with the corgwyn.

              If you choose to invest, I will work with my team to ensure
              updates so that you will know the difference you make. You can
              donate in small monthly amounts, single donation, or bi-annually;
              all directly to the funds or vets. As many of you know, running
              fundraisers is extremely time consuming & challenging. And sadly,
              my finances just do not allow me the luxury cushion I once had to
              easily provide for the corgis. Your participation will enable us
              to build a sustainable future to help corgis. Thank you seems too
              small a phrase to convey my gratitude; but know I most appreciably
              thank you!
